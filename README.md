# Farm Budget Data

The supplied crop budget information is designed to provide three function for Agricultural and Economic researchers 

1) To define the individual activities that take place in the typical production of the crop.  This proved the input needed (labor, machine use, fuel , fertilizer, pesticide, etc) for the production of the crop.

2) To estimate costs of production based on the prices/costs of the inputs.

2a) To estimate the time of the costs in the lifecycle of the crop

3) To estimate the net return based on expected yields and market prices for the crops.

Budgets for different regions can be different for the same crop because they either:

a) have a different management practice (different activities take place) 
b) prices for inputs are different.  
c) Yields are different
